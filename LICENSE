1. License grant and restrictions.

1.1 The Platform. The Company is the developer and provider of its proprietary AI based platform designated
to assist developers in creating software tests that help them test and debug their application code (the
“Platform”). The term "Platform" includes the on-premise extension to be locally installed on your
development environment (solely in object code form), and the cloud server that, inter alia, communicates
with such extension (accessible solely on a Software-as-a-Service basis), including any APIs with which
they are interfaced and their compilation of data, dashboard, algorithms, utility, application software
interfaces, tools, reports and analytics capabilities, visual display resulting from the operation of the
foregoing, any associated specifications, any service provided via such components and their related
documentation.

1.2 License. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company hereby grants you, and you accept, a limited,
personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, non-transferable and revocable license to
install and use the Platform solely for your internal use purposes, during the Term (as defined below)
(collectively, the “License”). The Platform should be installed and used in accordance with the instructions
of the Company and in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Platform's documentation.

2. Consideration.

2.1 Limited access to the Platform may currently be provided to you free of charge. However, in order to
exceed the usage caps which may be identified on the following link: https://www.startearly.ai/pricingearly,
as may be updated from time to time at our sole discretion (the “Pricing Page”) or otherwise to
receive access to any payment-bearing features or capabilities of the Platform, as may be described
therein, you may be required to purchase a subscription to the Platform, under specific subscription terms
detailed on the Pricing Page and/or on other pages you may interact with as part of your subscription
purchase process, such as the required fees and applicable billing cycles, use limitations, usage capacities
and technical requirements (the "Subscription", the “Subscription Terms” and the “Fees”, respectively).
We may make available more than one Subscriptions, under distinctive Subscription Terms. The
Subscription Terms associated with your Subscription are incorporated into this Agreement by reference,
provided that in the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Subscription Terms,
the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, we also reserve the right to
discontinue the availability of the free of charge version of the Platform at any time and require you to
pay fees for any further use of the Platform, all at our sole discretion and without any prior notice.

2.2 We may enable you to purchase a certain Subscription for multiple Users (the “Invited Users”). In such
case, we will send such Invited Users an e-mail invitation to open an Account (as defined and further
outlined below), using the contact details you shared about them (the “Invited Users”). Following the
installation of the Platform by each Invited User, and the opening of his/her Account, such each Invited
Users will be indicated, within the interface of the Platform, as to which Subscription he/she is entitled to
by virtue of your registration. You hereby undertake to provide us only with accurate and complete
contract details of your Invited Users.

2.3 In the event that you are an Invited User, the terms of this Section 2 (excluding Sections 2.2-2.3) will not
apply to you; however, you will still be subject to all other terms and condition of this Agreement,
including those pertaining to Subscriptions. You hereby acknowledge that the User’s handling,
management and/or maintenance of such Subscription, including without limitation the required
payments, cancellations, renewals, updates and/or changes, shall be controlled solely by the User who
purchased such Subscription for you, and the Company is not under any obligation to notify you about
any such developments. Accordingly, you hereby explicitly waive any claim against the Company as to
the terms, status or nature of your Subscription and any changes which may apply thereto, and you
acknowledge that you are solely responsible to verify this matter with such purchaser. In case you wish
to assume responsibility and control over a Subscription, you can always purchase a new, independent,
personal Subscription via the Pricing Page, which shall be completely separated from your Subscription
as an Invited User.

2.4 Regardless of whether the Fees are based on period-based billing cycles (e.g., monthly, annual fees, etc.)
(the “Billing Cycle(s)”), the Subscriptions are ongoing and shall continue until terminated by a Party in
accordance with Section 12 (Termination) below.

2.5 Unless specified otherwise in the Subscription Terms, the Fees for each Billing Cycle period shall be
billed in advance, namely, immediately at the time of the Subscription purchase, calculated for the initial
Billing Cycle on a pro rata basis, and periodically thereafter upon the commencement of the consecutive
Billing Cycle periods, namely on the 1st of each applicable month.

2.6 Unless otherwise required under applicable consumer laws, we may change the Subscription Terms,
including Fees, by notifying you of such change at least fifteen (15) days prior to the commencement of
the next Billing Cycle period (the “Notice Period”) and such change will not take effect during the Notice
Period. Your failure to notify us of cancellation of your Subscription during the Notice Period, will
constitute your consent to the updated Subscription Terms. We may enable you to make certain changes
to the Subscription Terms of an existing Subscription, and such changes will take effect with the next
Billing Cycle following the date such changes are made.

2.7 If you fail to pay the Fees set forth in the Subscription Terms on time, or if your payment information is
entered in error or does not go through for processing and you do not update payment information upon
our request, your entire Subscription may be suspended or cancelled and the Fees will accrue interest on
a daily basis until paid in full at the lesser of: (i) the rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month; or
(ii) the highest amount permitted by applicable law, and Early may take any other legal action to recover
the unpaid fees.

2.8 To the extent permitted under applicable consumer laws, all Fees and other amounts paid hereunder are
irrevocable and non-refundable. Unless otherwise stated, our charges do not include any taxes, levies,
duties or similar governmental assessments, including VAT, sales, use or withholding taxes required
under applicable law (collectively “Taxes”). You are responsible for paying Taxes except those which
are based on Company's revenue. We will charge you for such Taxes if we believe we have a legal
obligation to do so.

2.9 Payments of Fees may be processed via certain online payment service providers ("Online Payment
Processors"). We may add or change the Online Payment Processors at our sole discretion. The Online
Payment Processors enable you to send payments securely online using a credit card, debit card, or bank
account. We do not control and are not affiliated with such Online Payment Processors. These Online
Payment Processors are independent contractors and have no employment or agency relationship with the
Company. The Company is not responsible in any way for the actions or performance (or lack thereof) of
the Online Payment Processors. The use of the Online Payment Processors is at your own risk. It is your
responsibility to abide by all the terms specified by the Online Payment Processors in their terms of use
and privacy policies. You acknowledge that you are fully assuming the risks of conducting any
transactions via the Online Payment Processors.

Company’s website on: https://www.startearly.ai/ (the “Account”) which account shall be integrated with the
Platform. You are responsible for any activity that occurs within your Account and for safeguarding your
username and password, which you may not share or otherwise make available to any third party. We may
also enable you to open an Account by connecting with your existing third-party social network account, such
as your GitHub account ("Social Network Account”). To the extent that you have registered to the Platform
through your existing Social Network Account, the applicable social network will provide us with access to

necessary to enable us to access your Social Network Account (such as, your access token) in order to collect
and/or store, to the extent legally permissible, the abovementioned data. The manner in which the Social
Network Account uses, stores and discloses your information is governed solely by its policies and we shall
have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of the applicable social network.
You hereby agree that such information will be stored even after the linkage to your Social Network Account
expires, for any reason. You are responsible for any activity that occurs within your Account, and you may
not share your Account or otherwise enable any third party to access your Account. We may suspend or
terminate access to your Account and/or to the Platform if we believe, at our sole discretion, that one (or more)
of the following events has occurred: (a) there is a risk to the security or privacy of your Account; (b) there is
a threat to the security or integrity of our network or our servers; (c) suspension is needed to protect the rights,
property or safety of the Company, its users or the public, or for the proper operation of the Platform; (d) there
is a legitimate basis for termination of your Account; (e) you have violated this Agreement; and/or (f) we are
required to by law. We may provide you a notice in the event of any such suspension. During such suspension,
you will not have the ability to use or access your Account. In the event that we will determine, at our sole
discretion, that the reason for the suspension of access to your Account has been resolved, we will restore
access to your Account.

obtaining our prior express written approval.

12. Termination. The term of this Agreement shall start of the Effective Date and remain in effect until terminated

immediately upon the termination of your Subscription. In case you are using only the free version of the
Platform, you may terminate this Agreement at any time by uninstalling the Platform. In case you have any
Subscription in effect, you may terminate the Subscription by providing Early a written notice and such
termination will take effect at the end of your current Billing Cycle period, unless applicable consumer laws
require otherwise. The Company may immediately terminate this Agreement and/or any Subscription for any
reason by providing you a notice via e-mail or via the Platform. In addition, the Company reserves the right,
at its sole discretion, to cease the operation of the Platform or any part thereof, temporarily or permanently,
